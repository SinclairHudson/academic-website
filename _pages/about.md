I'm Sinclair, and I'm currently pursuing a Master's of Applied Computing at the University of Toronto. I complete my degree requirements in **December 2024** and will receive my diploma in May 2024. 
I'm doing research with NVIDIA, exploring self-supervised learning for autonomous vehicles. 
In May 2023, I completed my Bachelor's of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, with 6 internships.

My current (2024 Q3) research interests include:

* 🏋️ Self-supervised learning and unsupervised learning
* 🚙 Robotics (specifically autonomous vehicles)
* 🔊 ML for audio (specifically spoken language processing)
* 🎨 AI for creative and artistic applications

More generally, I'm interested in exploring creative research ideas that redefine problems or disrupt entrenched approaches.
I'm most excited by research driven by real-world problems, not benchmarks.

I'm not interested in the following research topics:

* 🪖 weapons or defense technology
* 📱 recommendation algorithms that exacerbate social media addiction
