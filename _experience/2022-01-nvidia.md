I worked on the LiDAR perception sub-team of the autonomous vehicles organization.
LiDAR is an awesome sensor modality, which is similar to computer vision but with a couple of very important differences.
In my experiments to improve object detection performance, I was doing a lot of 3D point cloud processing, with dense and sparse 3D convolutional networks.

## Going Sparse

LiDAR data is very sparse, so one of my big contributions was getting sparse tensors and sparse tensor networks working throughout a whole detection pipeline.
Sparse tensors allowed me to reduce the memory footprint of my network by 98%, while improving F-scores.
I was using Minkowski Engine, an open source sparse tensor deep learning library from NVIDIA, which has great integration with PyTorch.

## What I Learned

* Evaluating modern point cloud object detection methods on real data.
* Staying up to date on literature in the field.
* Working in a highly structured/safety-certified development environment.
* Production machine learning engineering, with changing requirements, compute resources, and approaches.
