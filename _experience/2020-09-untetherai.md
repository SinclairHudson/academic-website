Developing a Python library to optimize and process neural networks for an accelerated inference chip.

## Integer only!
UntetherAI's chip at the time was integer-only, by design.
Specifically, all of the cores could only do int-8 operations, meaning that every
activation and weight could only have 256 unique values.
The math that enables int-8 quantization to work is really cool, and I learned a lot about how neural networks work down to the hardware level.
Asymmetric and symmetric quantization schemes, quantization-aware training, quantization noise.

## Non-Max Suppression
One of the things I'm most proud of from my time at Untether

## Vim era
This is also where I started learning how to use vim, and how to use vim properly.
Big shout out to my mentor Ingo; he showed me what 20 years of vim experience could do, and he also encouraged me constantly.
