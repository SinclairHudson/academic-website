For my last internship of my undergrad, I worked at Cruise building tooling for deploying models to their autonomous vehicles.

## Model Deployment Debugging
My project focused on debugging the process of deployment. 
At the time, Cruise had a pretty mature deployment system set up. 
However, when it didn't work, it often
1. failed silently
2. failed only at the end of the process

The technologies we were using made model deployment a pain to debug.
I was building tools that could assist in the debugging process, like a linter or a tool to manually inspect intermediate activation distributions.
The project was fun in that I got to build for machine learning engineers, customers that I understand. 
I also really liked it when someone would message me on Slack telling me my new tool saved them hours while debugging their model. :)
