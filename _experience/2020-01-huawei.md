Exploring LiDAR semantic segmentation, and shooting for state-of-the-art results. 

## LiDAR Segmentation
We were benchmark chasing, focused on the SemanticKITTI benchmark.
I gained good experience running and managing experiments, justifying experiments, and iterating quickly in a research repository.
I also got used to reading papers to the level that I could implement their ideas from scratch.
Looking back, my experiments weren't anything special. I think my supervisors implemented most of the radical ideas.
Still, I was implementing the work of others, ideas from papers without a public code release.
I learned a lot about PyTorch, and the research process in general.

## Pandemic!
This was actually the first time in my career I worked remotely; the last month we were all sent home with laptops to work remotely.
Not a great time!
